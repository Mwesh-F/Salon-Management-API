# üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Salon Booking & Management System  
_A Capstone Project Adapted from a Task Management API_  

## üìå Overview  
The **Salon Booking & Management System** is a web-based **Task Management API** built using **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.  

It is tailored for small to medium-sized beauty salons to simplify:  
- Appointment scheduling  
- Service management  
- Staff management  
- Client reminders  

This project demonstrates **backend engineering skills** such as **user authentication, CRUD operations, model relationships, API design, and deployment**.  

---

## üéØ Core Features  
- **User Authentication**: Clients, Staff, and Admins  
- **Service Management**: Add, update, delete, and list salon services  
- **Booking Management (Tasks)**: Create, update, cancel, and track appointments  
- **Recurring Tasks**: Auto-schedule appointments every 6 weeks  
- **Reminders**: Notify clients when their appointment is near  
- **Staff Assignment**: Assign staff to specific bookings  
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, Staff, and Clients have different permissions  
- **Dashboard (API-based)**: For staff and admins to view/manage services and bookings  

---

## üõ† Tech Stack  
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework (DRF)  
- **Database**: SQLite/PostgreSQL (Django ORM)  
- **Authentication**: Django Auth (JWT/Session)  
- **Deployment**: Heroku / PythonAnywhere  

---

## üóÇ Django App Structure  
## üß™ API Testing

Basic tests for user registration, service creation, booking creation, and booking update/cancellation are included in `tests.py`.

To run the tests:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

Each test checks response status codes and returned data to make sure the API works as expected.

- **Staff** ‚Üí Manages staff info and authentication
